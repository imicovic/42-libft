# Libft - 42 Wolfsburg project about reinventing the wheel for educational purposes!

Usualy I recommend reading [the subject](en.subject.pdf) for better understanding the project but.. Like I said, this project is about reinventing the wheel which is pretty straight forward. I recreated standard libc functions like strlen, bzero, memset, atoi... After which I created some subject-specific functions like ft_itoa (reverse atoi) and learned how to use linked lists.
