# Libft - 42 Wolfsburg project about reinventing the wheel for educational purposes!



Usualy I recommend reading [the subject](en.subject.pdf) for better understanding the project but.. Like I said, this project is about reinventing the wheel which is pretty straight forward. I recreated standard libc functions like `strlen`, `bzero`, `memset`, `atoi`... After which I created some subject-specific functions like `ft_itoa` (reverse atoi) and learned how to use linked lists.
